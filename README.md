# Large-scale-document-retrieval-and-ranking

Don't you have thounds and thounds text files you want search something in it. Let's this algorithm help you, there wasn't UI, but can directly tell you the thing you want seach is in which file / or which file may related with your search?

Design based on Vector Space Model (VSM)

1. Information retrieval system:
This vector space model can be applied to search engines, e-commerce product search, enterprise document management and other scenarios to help quickly locate documents or product information related to the query.
2. Large-scale text mining and analysis:
With Spark's distributed computing, it is possible to efficiently build indexes and conduct rapid searches on massive document sets, providing support for intelligence analysis, public opinion monitoring and academic literature retrieval.
3. Personalization and recommendation:
When users perform specific keyword queries, the system can use document similarity rankings and additional personalized models to recommend other documents or content that may be of interest to them, thereby improving the efficiency of user search and discovery.
